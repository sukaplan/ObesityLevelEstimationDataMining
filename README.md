# ObesityLevelEstimationDataMining
### Medical Data Mining on Obesity Level Estimations

This application uses the Obesity Level Estimation Dataset to have an understanding about the factors that contribute to obesity and the relationship between them.
Finally, three different machine learning models have been trained on this dataset using the factors such as age, weight or height, to have an estimated guess of having diabetes
and if so, which category of diabetes it fits into.

Machine Learning Models: 
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification

Dataset: Palechor, F. M., & de la Hoz Manotas, A. (2019). 
Dataset for estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition in individuals from Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. Data in Brief, 104344.
